in-progress project, 

which should ultimately
1. go to a user's AO3 bookmarks & subscribed authors
2. check an author's published works
3. and return a list of fandoms that they have written in.

when you start reading in a new fandom,
you can use this to check authors you know you already like
to see if they've written in your new fandom already.
